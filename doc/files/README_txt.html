      <h1>appointme</h1>
<pre>
  Appointme is a simple schedule in natural language. With this, you can put your appointments in your schedule simply typing what you will do and when you will do it.
  It's my first experience with BDD practices and today I'm very happy because rspec runs ok! I'm driving this project with specs.

</ul>
<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<h2>FEATURES/PROBLEMS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>my first challenge here:

<pre>
 - how can i keep this project DRY(Don't repeat yourself)?
   #=&gt; an example for it about time and date:
     I can speak about hours a lot of tips like:
        at num, afternum, 3 o'clock, 02:00 AM, etc.

     on the date:
       today, yesterday, 3 years ago, 2 weeks, this week, etc.

     I'm using chronic for solve this problem.

   Chronic is a good gem and works well. It works with a simple pattern implementing for the words with some tokens recognized.
   There are some classes understanding about time, weeks, months, hours and other stuff like that. And each word should recognize or not for some classes, puting in future or past context, by default it runs with future context.
   Passing by several filters in each word, example:
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
# normalize string parameter # split the phrase and return a array of
tokens. # scan all words and get base of tokens for each word. # select all
tagged words
</p>
<p>
it runs well but I knew that can&#8216;t return non tagged words because on
the code I found
</p>
<p>
@tokens = @tokens.select{|word| workd.tagged?}
</p>
<p>
and in this line I found what I didn&#8216;t want, because put a new
appointment is divided by 2 parts time and description, and when I put some
phrase like: &quot;i will go to the dentist tomorrow at 3&quot; I have 3
words with time and other words should be the description for appointment.
Of course I change this line:
</p>
<p>
@tokens = @tokens.select{|token| token.tagged?}
</p>
<p>
to:
</p>
<p>
@tokens, @non_tagged_tokens = @tokens.partition { |token| token.tagged? }
</p>
<p>
and with this I know that @non_tagged_tokens should be some array with
words that shouldn&#8216;t have time and is this the description for my
appointment. It&#8216;s really awesome now and because this I left Osiris
chatterbot implementation and I intend to just parse some words to see and
erase some time in my schedule. Solving my problem there&#8216;s
</p>
