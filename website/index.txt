h1. 'appointme'
  Appointme is a simple schedule in natural language. With this, you can put your appointments in your schedule simply typing what you will do and when you will do it.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install appointme</pre>

h2. The basics

  Just with "Chronic gem":http://chronic.rubyforge.org I parse some phrase like:
 <pre syntax="ruby"> 
   puts  Chronic.parse("next saturday at 8").inspect
   # Sat Nov 01 08:00:00 -0200 2008
 </pre>

  with a lot of options like this I just split the rest of the time description to see and put new appointments on the schedule:
  
 <pre syntax="ruby"> 

   include Appointme

   schedule = Schedule.new 

   go_to_english_class = Appointment.new :when => "next saturday at 3",
                                         :description => "english class"

   schedule.appointments << go_to_english_class

   puts schedule.appointments # when?: Saturday(01) at 15:00 - english class

 </pre>

h2. Using static methods to be more easy

 <pre syntax="ruby"> 

    Appointme.understand "tomorrow at 8 wake up man!"
    Appointme.understand "tomorrow at 9 work, work"
    Appointme.understand "eat some japanese food with mary tomorrow at noon"
    Appointme.understand "tomorrow at 6:10pm get out job drink some beers"
    Appointme.understand "tomorrow at 6:30pm happy hour! woohooo"
    
    puts Appointme.understand "show tomorrow at 6 pm" 

    when?: Monday(27) at 18:10 - get out job drink some beers
    when?: Monday(27) at 18:30 - happy hour! woohooo

 </pre>
